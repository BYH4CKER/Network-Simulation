# A report was prepared within the scope of this course and a general overview of the networks was given. I share the report and the simulation environment and hope that it will benefit people.

#In the simulation, a few basic applications such as SNMP query, DHCP server detection, network port scanning, detection of live devices were tested in the Python environment and their outputs were added to the report.
